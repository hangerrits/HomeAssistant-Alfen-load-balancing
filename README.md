# HomeAssistant Alfen load balancing
Load balancing in HomeAssistant for Alfen charger

Looks at the power usage in home and calculates the max available power for the charger

Writes to charger whenever max_charger_current changes,
and each 5 minutes so that the value stays active
and prevent the charger to fall back to safe current
